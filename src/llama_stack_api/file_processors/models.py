"""Pydantic models for File Processors API requests and responses.

This module defines the request and response models for the File Processors API
using Pydantic with Field descriptions for OpenAPI schema generation.

The ProcessFileRequest model wraps the serializable parameters for file processing.
The UploadFile parameter is kept separate (not serializable), following the same
pattern as UploadFileRequest in the Files API.
