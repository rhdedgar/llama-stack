    File Processor API for converting files into structured, processable content.

    This API provides a flexible interface for processing various file formats
    (PDFs, documents, images, etc.) into normalized text content that can be used for
    vector store ingestion, RAG applications, or standalone content extraction.

    The API focuses on parsing and normalization:
    - Multiple file formats through extensible provider architecture
    - Multipart form uploads or file ID references
    - Configurable processing options per provider
    - Optional chunking using provider's native capabilities
    - Rich metadata about processing results

    For embedding generation, use the chunks from this API with the separate
    embedding API to maintain clean separation of concerns.

    Future providers can extend this interface to support additional formats,
    processing capabilities, and optimization strategies.

        Process a file into chunks ready for vector database storage.

        This method supports two modes of operation via multipart form request:
        1. Direct upload: Upload and process a file directly (file parameter)
        2. File storage: Process files already uploaded to file storage (request.file_id parameter)

        Exactly one of file or request.file_id must be provided.
