Integration test demonstrating provider error recording and replay.

This test verifies the core feature of PR #4880: when a provider SDK raises an
exception during a live API call (record mode), the recording system serializes
the exception. On subsequent runs (replay mode), the same exception is
deserialized and re-raised so the test passes identically without a live
provider connection.

Run in record mode (requires a live provider, e.g. Ollama or OpenAI):
    pytest tests/integration/inference/test_provider_error_recording.py \\
        --setup=ollama --stack-config=server:starter --inference-mode=record

Run in replay mode (uses committed recording, no live provider needed):
    pytest tests/integration/inference/test_provider_error_recording.py \\
        --setup=ollama --inference-mode=replay
